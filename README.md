# 1TD169 Data Engineering 1
Repo for the course 1TD169 Data Engineering 1.

## Course Content
The course gave an introduction to the field of data engineering.

In the course we worked on the Swedish Science Cloud cloud platform where we deployed virtual machines that were used throughout the course.

The course provided hands-on experience with:
- Cloud infrastructure
- bash
- Git
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- MongoDB
- Running services of VMs

The "A1" folder contains the output of the first assignment which provided an introduction to working with VMs and the command-line.
The "A3" folder contains the ouput of the third assignment which used Apache Spark to analyze a large data set.
The second assignment was an introduction to Hadoop and HDFS but was entirely run from the command-line, thus not getting its own folder.

## Course Project
The course included a project that can be found in [this](https://github.com/alexandersundquist/1TD169-Data-Engineering-1-Project) repo.
